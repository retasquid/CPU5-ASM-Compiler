# CPU5-ASM-Compiler
Simple custom ASM compiler for my CPU5.

# How to use
First, write your assembly language in the main.asm file.
Then, run the python script, you can give the asm file name and the output file name in argument like "python compiler.py myfile.asm myoutput.hex", output file can be hex, bin, C header or verilog by default.

# Custom Color pack for VsCode
You can install the color pack for VScode by pasting the "custom-asm-language" file in *C:\Users\{YOUR-NAME}\.vscode\extensions* on Windows and in "~/.vscode/extensions/" on Linux/MacOS.
Then modify your extensions.json by adding : 
```
{"identifier":{"id":"undefined_publisher.custom-asm-language"},"version":"0.0.1","location":{"$mid":1,"path":"/c:/Users/{YOUR-NAME}/.vscode/extensions/custom-asm-language","scheme":"file"},"relativeLocation":"custom-asm-language"}
```
# CPU Flash Programer
The flasher is the flash programer for the CPU 5.9, it take the code from the header file generated by the compiler and write it to the SPI Flash Chip (built for Macronix MX25L serie).
After each assembly compiling, you need to plug the SPI Flash with the ÂµC pins of your choise and compile whith the header file containing the code. A COM interface will appear and show you the programing progres.

For now, the interface is in French :

I recommande using new arduino / esp board that can store more than 256 KB in flash and that store const variables in flash and not in Ram else you will be limited in code lenght
